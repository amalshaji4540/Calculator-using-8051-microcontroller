# Calculator using  8051 microcontroller
The aim of the project is to build a calculator using
edsim51 8051 microcontroller simulator. C programming language is used.C program is
converted into assembly language by using sdcc compiler.

### Softwares used
● Edsim51 (8051 simulator)

● Vs code (code editor)

● SDCC (compiler)

### How to use the calculator
● It is possible to enter upto 4 digit numbers in the
calculator.

● Numbers should be entered from left to right(ie,if we
want to enter number 52 first we need to enter 2 ,
then 5 is to be entered).

● For selecting the operation star key is used.If star
key(‘*’) is pressed once addition is done..If star
key(‘*’) is pressed twice subtraction is done..If star
key(‘*’) is pressed 3 times multiplication is done..If
star key(‘*’) is pressed 4 times, division is done.

● If addition operation is selected, ‘A’ is displayed on
Led segments also ‘AA’,’AAA’,’AAAA’ displayed for
subtraction ,multiplication and division respectively.

● ‘#’ key is used for getting the answer.

● First number is entered then the operation is selected
using the ‘*’ key and then the second number is
entered and ‘#’ is used for getting the answer.
